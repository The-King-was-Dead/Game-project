# The king was Dead

The kingdom was in an uproar. The king was dead, murdered by an evil wizard who had taken over the throne. The people were afraid and didn't know what to do. However, unbeknownst to him, one of his artefacts was cursed with immortality causing the king's spirit to be trapped in the artefact. Corrupting and causing the king to take the appearance of a beast. As the king returned to life, he met the wizard who had placed such a curse on the artefacts. And discovered that the only way to break the curse and regain his humanity was to rescue his kingdom and get rid of the evil wizard that killed him. The king set out on a quest to find the wizard and kill him. He travelled to many different places, fighting battles and overcoming many obstacles. He encountered many of his trusty subjects from the kingdom, which managed to escape from the wicked wizard. Finally, he reached the wizard's castle. He fought the wizard and won, breaking the curse and regaining his humanity. Or so the story should have unfolded.
